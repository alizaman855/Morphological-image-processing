# Morphological-image-processing
Morphological image processing (or morphology) describes a range of image processing techniques that deal with the shape (or morphology) of features in an image. Morphological operations are typically applied to remove imperfections introduced during segmentation, and they are typically operate on binary (where the pixels of the image can only be 0 or 1) images.
